# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


The class project for Getting and Cleaning Data was to read in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set, perform an analysis on the data set, and save a tidy data set.

Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:

Download the zip file from this URL - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
Unzip the file.
Move ALL of the following files to the SAME DIRECTORY as the R script:
features.txt
subject_train.txt
subject_test.txt
X_train.txt
X_test.txt
y_train.txt
y_test.txt

Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script (run_analysis.R). 
The R script requires the reshape2 package.

The output of the R script is a tidy data set, named tidy.txt.

More information about the description of each data files and the steps taked can be found in the code book.
